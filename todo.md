## Necesairy
- [ ] save urls of jobs
## Nice to have
- [ ] enable scraping of more keywords at the same time
- [ ] Analyze the most expected skills
- [ ] scrape and AI at the same time
- [ ] show how many new jobs were found in the latest scraping sesh
- [ ] add a ranking system to order jobs instead of removing
    - maybe something like Angular: 1, C# 0.5, Java: -1, TypeScript: 1 => (1 + 0.5 + -1 + 1) / 4 
- [ ] take into account 'required' and 'optional' skills (they are just removed now)
- [ ] gather which skills I have
- [ ] fetch jobs from the db based on criteria
- [ ] more sources
