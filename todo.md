## Nice to have
- [ ] more sources
- [ ] Analyze the most expected skills
- [ ] scrape and AI at the same time
- [x] enable scraping of more keywords at the same time
- [x] add a ranking system to order jobs instead of removing
    - maybe something like Angular: 1, C# 0.5, Java: -1, TypeScript: 1 => (1 + 0.5 + -1 + 1) / 4 
- [x] take into account 'required' and 'optional' skills (they are just removed now)
- [x] gather which skills I have
- [x] fetch jobs from the db based on criteria
- [x] show how many new jobs were found in the latest scraping sesh
- [x] Make sure that when we look for "following" that it's the right blue button
- [x] Store in the db how many people I followed today so that I don't overdo it and get banned
